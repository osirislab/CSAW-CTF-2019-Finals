It was introduced in Linux Kernel version 5.3.\n\nBUGS\n    Nobody knows precisely what unfork() does; avoid it in portable programs. Or avoid it altogether: use exit(2) instead, if that is what you mean. Do not use unfork().\n\nAUTHOR\n    Written by Nick Gregory (@kallsyms, @capsule8) and Josh Hofing (@hyperosonic, @trailofbits).\n\nSEE ALSO\n    fork(2), exit(2)\n\n\n`nc {{.Netloc}} {{.DescPort}}`",
