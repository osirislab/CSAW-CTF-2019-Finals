# unfork

## Intended Solution

* Review included patch file
* Note stray `fput` if `__alloc_fd` fails
* Create a program which
    * sets fd rlimit to 6
    * repeatedly (~10x)
        * forks
        * child opens /dev/null (or anything else) and calls unfork (leaving fd 3 dangling)
        * parent sets fd rlimit to cur+3
    * parent forks again, child execs `passwd`
    * eventually `/etc/shadow` will get opened RW
    * parent signals all original children which attempt to write to fd 3 (one of them should have the shadow fd)
        * overwrite some known root password
    * `su root` and `cat /flag`
