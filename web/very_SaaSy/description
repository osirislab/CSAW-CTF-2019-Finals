I thought my SaaS was really cool, but 3 users complained that it was too slow for them :(
And before I could fix it, they sent me the flag that I hid!
After I changed the flag, I fixed SaaS; it should scale WAY better now.

The flag is still at /flag on the web server, totally separate from the server the void is on.
Not that it will matter, since nobody will ever get it!
