Key: YOUAREAMAZE
Variants: ENTERANDFINDTHEKEYISYOUAREAMAZE, ANDFINDTHEKEYISYOUAREAMAZE

How to solve:
- There is a single .cpp file with a lot of generated code.
- At the end there is an ENTER function, and a comment referencing a
libFuzzer harness entrypoint.
- Fill in that harness, call ENTER, compile and start fuzzing.
- There *should* only be one control flow that crashes and the stack
trace prints.

What could go wrong: I have not formally verified there is only one
crash path. But I've fuzzed several times with several input seeds and
they all crash on this path. The codegen logic has some context to
enforce this is the only correct path but I tried to make it
non-obvious to angr/cfg-inspect/etc so there is a chance I introduced
a bug.

If someone crashes it with another stack trace, I can verify if they
provide the base64 of the input.
