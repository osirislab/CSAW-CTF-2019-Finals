## Steady Counting

This is an ins counting challenge for RE 150 in CSAW Challenge

The solver requires intel pin tool to run, if you'd like me to test out the solver, you should
find me during the competition and ask me to test it out, as your box probably does not have pin tool built on it.

The binary is obfuscated with some custom obfuscation and the symbols are stripped
